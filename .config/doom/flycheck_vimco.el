;;; Commentary:
;; This file defines a vim to emacs theme converter. It should be used through
;; an interactive function `vimco-convert-vim-theme', which assumes vim themes
;; are located in "~/.vim/colors".
;;
;; There's no reason to have this file loaded in Emacs at all times, so it can
;; loaded with `load-file' or evaluated with `eval-buffer'.
;;
;; This code is based on code from
;; <https://github.com/zphr/vim-theme-converter.el>
